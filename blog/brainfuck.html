                <p class="date">Posted on October, 1st 2021</p>
                <p>After my blog about <a href="/blog/wireworld/">Wireworld</a>, I
                    discovered a programming language called 'Brainfuck' and it pretty much does as it says. Some people
                    prefer to call it Brainf***, Brainbleep, Brainf*ck or even Br*infuck but I'll just stick with the
                    original name from now on.</p>
                <img class="stretch-img" src="brainfuck/hello_word.png" title="Hello World in Brainfuck">
                <p>Languages like Brainfuck are called esoteric languages, basically the point of them is that they're
                    funny and completely impractical to use. Malbolge is just one example so just try and guess what
                    this does.</p>
                <img class="stretch-img" src="brainfuck/malbolge.png" title="Hello World in Malbolge">
                <p>There are only 8 different characters in total: + - [ ] <> , .<br>
                        Anything else will be ignored when the script is run. Imagine a long line of numbers all start
                        at 0. The < and> characters select the number on the left and right respectively. The + and -
                            characters increase and decrease the number.</p>
                <p>The other 4 are a bit harder. The . converts the currently selected number to an ASCII character and
                    prints it to the console. The , gets an inputed character from the user and sets the currently
                    selected number to that character's ASCII code. Lastly, if the current selected value is 0 then the
                    [ character will skip to its corresponding ]. If the value isn't zero at the ], then it will rerun
                    everything in between the []s. This may sound complicated but basically it will loop over the code
                    in the []s until the currently selected number is 0.</p>
                <p>Brainfuck is also a Turing-tarpit, meaning it could technically be programmed to complete the Turing
                    test but its completely unrealistic and unreasonable to do so. Writing 'Hello world' is hard enough
                    as it is.</p>
                <p>I'm trying to think of more stuff to write but I don't want to waffle on for too long so basically just go look at my <a href="/brainfuck">Brainfuck interpreter</a> (all the cool kids use it)</p>
                <p>See you for the next blog kiddos.</p>
